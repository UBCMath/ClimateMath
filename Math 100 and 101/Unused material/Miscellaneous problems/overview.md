The miscellaneous problems in this folder are problems created as part of the Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund: “Math and EOAS Collaborate to Improve Climate Education at UBC” which did not make it into any of the large assignments created. Some of these questions are designed as assignment questions and could easily be turned into an assignment and others are designed to either complement an existing assignment or be used in-class with students.
