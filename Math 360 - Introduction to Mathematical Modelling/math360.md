Math 360 - Introduction to Mathematical Modelling is a course which introduces students to deterministic, stochastic, and data-driven models. The most recent iteration of this course was designed by [Lindsey Daniels](https://www.math.ubc.ca/user/3614) and [Patrick Walls](https://patrickwalls.github.io/), who were part of the TLEF grant: “Math and EOAS Collaborate to Improve Climate Education at UBC”. Their course webpage is [here](https://github.com/UBCMath/MATH360) and part of the deterministic modelling section was focused on the Energy Balance Model (see [here](https://github.com/UBCMath/MATH360/tree/main/deterministic/heat)).
