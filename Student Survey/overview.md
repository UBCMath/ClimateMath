At the end of the first year of the Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund: “Math and EOAS Collaborate to Improve Climate Education at UBC”, we sent out a survey to all students who had received materials that were developed as part of the grant in their courses. The survey questions can be seen in the pdf and we are currently writing a paper which will contain the results of the survey.
